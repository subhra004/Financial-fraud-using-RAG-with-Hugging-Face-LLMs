## RAG Financial Fraud Detection Using Hugging Face and LLM Model

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for detecting financial fraud using domain-specific documents and large language models (LLMs) from Hugging Face. It leverages semantic search, document embeddings, and LLM-powered reasoning to answer queries and detect potential red flags in financial reports.

## 📌 Features

💼 Loads and indexes financial documents (PDFs or text)

🧠 Uses LLMs (BioMistral or any Hugging Face model) to answer financial fraud-related questions

🔍 Implements RAG pipeline using LangChain, FAISS, and Transformers

🗃️ Vector store creation with embedded chunks for efficient retrieval

📈 Ideal for auditors, investigators, and researchers analyzing financial documents



## 🧠 Tech Stack
